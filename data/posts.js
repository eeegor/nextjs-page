      "It was a normal day at the office for the software developer. They were working on their latest project when their dog, who had been sleeping under their desk, suddenly woke up and started chewing on something. The developer didn't think much of it until they realized that their dog was chewing on their USB drive that had their latest code backup on it.</br></br>The developer tried to take the drive away from the dog, but it was too late. The dog had already eaten the entire thing. The developer was horrified as they realized that all their work was now gone. They would have to start from scratch. Thankfully, they had a few previous backups, but it was still a huge setback.</br></br>The developer learned their lesson and now always keeps their code backups in a safe place, well out of reach of their furry friend.",
